> This is a solo project being built in our third module of our curriculum at microverse. This branch is the third step of the Math Magicians application. in this branch React events is developed that manipulates logical operations of the calculator

Our goal here is to Build a Maths calculator using the React library Click [here](https://usorfaitheloho-mathsmagician.netlify.app/) to get a live preview of the project

### Features implemented so far are:

- integrated create-react-app
- install linters
- use React components
- Implement React events and logic to perform operations

## Built With

- Stylelint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles).
- ESlint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in JavaScript codes)
- React (A free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The basic requirements for building the executable are:

- A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
- VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
- Node Package Manager (For installing packages like Lighthous, webhint & stylelint used for checking for debugging bad codes before deployment)

# Getting Started

#### Cloning the project

```
git clone  https://github.com/usorfaitheloho/Maths-Magician.git <Your-Build-Directory>
```

## Getting packages and dependencies
To get all package modules required to build the project run:
```
npm install
```
every package module required to build the project is listed in the package.json file. this is used as a reference to get all dependencies.

## Building 

To build the project run:
```
npm run build
```
after you run this sucessfully you'd locate the build from in the ```dist``` folder located from the parent directory of the project. two files are being built which are, ```main.js and index.html```

## Running

To run the program on a browser through a server run this command in your cli
```
npm start
```
This should open the page in your localhost on port 8080. then you'd be able to view the built page generated using webpack.
